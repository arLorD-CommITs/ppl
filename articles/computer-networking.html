                <h1 id="definition">Discover computer networking</h1>
                <p>Computer networking refers to the connection of multiple devices to share data, resources, and services. It involves the establishment of communication channels and protocols that enable devices to exchange information efficiently. Networking allows computers, smartphones, tablets, servers, and other devices to communicate with each other, forming complex networks that span vast distances.</p>

                <h2 id="key">Key components</h2>
                <p>Computer networks are composed of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li id="nodes"><strong>Nodes</strong>: Individual devices connected to a network, such as computers, servers, routers, switches, and printers. Each node has a unique identifier, known as an Internet Protocol (IP) address, which facilitates communication within the network.</li>
                    <li id="links"><strong>Links</strong>: Physical or logical connections between nodes, enabling data transmission. These links can be wired (e.g. Ethernet cables) or wireless (e.g, Wi-Fi), depending on the network architecture.</li>
                    <li id="protocols"><strong>Protocols</strong>: Rules and conventions that govern communication between devices in a network. Common networking protocols include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)</li>
                            <li>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</li>
                            <li>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</li>
                            <li>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li id="routers"><strong>Routers and switches</strong>: Network devices that facilitate data routing and forwarding within a network. Routers direct data packets between different networks, while switches manage data traffic within a Local Area Network (LAN).</li>
                    <li id="topology"><strong>Network topology</strong>: Physical or logical layout of a network, which includes how nodes and links are interconnected. Common network topologies include: 
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Star</strong>: A central server node is linked to multiple client network devices. This topology performs better as data doesnâ€™t have to go through each node. It is also more reliable.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bus</strong>: Each node is linked to one other node only. Data transmission over the network connections occurs in one direction.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ring</strong>: Each node is linked to two other nodes, forming a ring. Data can flow bi-directionally. However,single node failure can bring down the entire network.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mesh</strong>: Every node is connected to many other nodes. In a full mesh topology, every node is connected to every other node in the network.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hybrid</strong>: Combines two or more different types of network topologies to form a single integrated network.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="network-types">Network types</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Local Area Network (LAN)</strong>: Covers a small geographical area, such as a home, office, or campus. It allows devices within the same location to share resources and access the internet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wide Area Network (WAN)</strong>: Spans large geographical areas and connects multiple LANs or other networks. It utilizes long-distance communication technologies, such as leased lines, fiber-optic cables, and satellite links, to facilitate data transmission over extended distances.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wireless Networks</strong>: Uses radio waves to connect devices without the need for physical cables. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks are common examples of wireless technologies that enable mobile connectivity and internet access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Internet</strong>: Global network of networks that connects billions of devices worldwide. It operates on a decentralized architecture and relies on TCP/IP protocols to enable communication between devices across diverse networks.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="network-architectures">Network architectures</h2>
                <h3>Client-server architecture</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nodes can be servers or clients. </li>
                    <li>Server nodes provide resources like memory, processing power, or data to client nodes. </li>
                    <li>Server nodes may also manage client node behavior. </li>
                    <li>Clients may communicate with each other, but they do not share resources.
                        <div class="note">
                            <p><strong>Example</strong>: Some computers in enterprise networks store data and configuration settings. These computers are the servers in the network. Clients can send requests to these servers to access data.</p>
                        </div>        
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Connected computers have equal powers and privileges. </li>
                    <li>There is no central server for coordination. </li>
                    <li>Each device in the computer network can act as either client or server. </li>
                    <li>Each peer may share some of its resources, like memory and processing power, with the entire computer network. 
                        <div class="note">
                            <p><strong>Example</strong>: Some companies use P2P architecture to host memory-consuming applications, such as 3-D graphic rendering, across multiple digital devices.</p>
                        </div>
