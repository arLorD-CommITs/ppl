                <h1>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h1>
                <p>SDLC is a methodology used by software developers to design, develop, test, and deploy software systems. SDLC is composed of several phases, each with its own set of activities and goals. These phases include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Planning</strong>: Define the project scope, objectives, requirements, and timelines.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analysis</strong>: Gather and analyze requirements from stakeholders to understand the needs of the end-users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Design</strong>: Create the architecture, system specifications, and user interface design based on the requirements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Implementation</strong>: Write code, develop software components, and integrate them into a working system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing</strong>: Verify that the software meets the specified requirements and is free of defects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deployment</strong>: Release the software to users, often in a controlled manner to minimize disruption.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintenance</strong>: Provide ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software to ensure its continued functionality and relevance.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Importance of SDLC</h2>
                <p>The management of software development can be complex due to evolving requirements, technology advancements, and collaboration across teams. SDLC offers a structured framework with defined milestones throughout the development process. This ensures stakeholders align on goals, requirements, and execution strategies upfront. </p>
