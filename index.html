                <p>This program is recommended for people who are just starting their fitness journey. You can do this at home with a pair of adjustable dumbbells and is suitable if you're in an area with limited access to gym equipment.</p>
                <p>This workout is essentially a dumbbell-centric routine. Therefore, the exercises are designed to work the advantages of dumbbells. Though there are some exercises (e.g. Squats), where you can opt to use a barbell instead.</p>
                <div class="note">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Note</strong>: While you can expect strength gains from this routine, it's designed more with hypertrophy in mind. 
                    </p>

                <p>A PPL split is a simple training schedule that trains different muscle groups on different days of the week.</p>
                <ul>
                    <span>
                        <li><strong>Push</strong>: The goal is to train all the upper body pushing muscles (i.e. the chest, shoulders, and triceps).</li>
                    </span>
                    <li><strong>Pull</strong>: You train all the upper body pulling muscles (e.g. the back and biceps).</li>
                    <li><strong>Legs</strong>: You focus training on the entire lower body.</li>
                    <div class="note">
                        <p>
                            <strong>Note</strong>: Breaking up workouts into push, pull, and legs maximizes work and rest to help you make gains.
                        </p>
                        <p>Additionally, PPL splits prioritize movement over individual muscle groups to effectively build functional strength.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dumbbells</strong>: You need a range of dumbbells or a pair of adjustable dumbbells. The heavier your dumbbells go, the longer you will be able to make use of this routine.</li>
                    <div class="note">
                        <p><strong>Note</strong>: This routine is not a practical option if you only have a single pair of dumbbells.</p>
                    </div>
                    <li><strong>Bench</strong>: Ideally you will have access to an adjustable bench. If you only have a flat bench, replace incline fly with flat fly on push day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pull-up bar</strong>: Every gym should have at least some place to do pull-ups. If you are working out at home buy a simple door-mounted bar.</li>

                <h2 id="progression" class="progression">Progression</h2>
                <p>Perform three sets for each exercise, with 90 seconds rest in between each set. Do as many repetitions (reps) as possible, but no more than 12, for each set. For exercises that work each side individually (e.g. bent-over rows, lunges) a set counts after you have done both sides, and be sure to do the same number of reps per set on each side. If you are able to perform all three sets for 12 reps then move up to the next available weight on the next workout. If you do not make progress (increasing reps does count as progress) on an individual exercise after two attempts (i.e. you use the same weight and reps on that exercise for three consecutive workouts) then deload the weight for that specific exercise by two increments for the following workout and work your way back up.</p>
                <p>For pull-ups and hanging leg raises start with bodyweight only. To add weight hold a dumbbell between your feet. If you cannot do a pull-up, begin with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fitstream.com/exercises/negative-pull-up-a6041">negatives</a></p>
                <p>Start with the lightest dumbbells available for all other exercises. This will make sure you don't overdo it as you first start out and also allow you to practice form.</p>

                <h2 id="schedule" class="schedule">Schedule</h2>
                <p>If you are getting adequate sleep and rest and like having the same schedule every week you may do the workouts on consecutive days as follows: Push/Pull/Legs/Push/Pull/Legs/Rest. Alternatively, you may use a four day cycle of Push/Pull/Legs/Rest.

                <h2 id="squats" class="squats">Squats</h2>
                <p>Since we all love leg days, squats deserve their own section. Because r/fitness loves squats I figure they deserve their own paragraph. Goblet squats are likely to be the limiting factor in this routine, in that you will probably reach your maximum dumbbell weight on this exercise first. When you do you may either move goblet squats to the end of leg day or replace them with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/DBSingleLegSplitSquat.html">Bulgarian split squats</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/DBSingleLegSplitSquat">pistol squats</a></p>
