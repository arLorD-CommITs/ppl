                <p>This program is ideal for beginners and can be performed at home with a pair of adjustable dumbbells. It's also suitable for those with limited access to gym equipment.</p>
                <p>This workout focuses on dumbbell exercises, capitalizing on their benefits. However, for certain exercises like squats, you have the option to use a barbell instead.</p>
                <div class="note">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Note</strong>: While you can expect strength gains from this routine, it's designed more with hypertrophy in mind. 
                    </p>

                <p>A well-rounded physique demands targeted training. PPL divides workouts into push, pull, and leg exercises. By emphasizing compound movements and ample volume, this routine promotes muscle growth, and overall fitness.</p>
                <ul>
                    <span>
                        <li><strong>Push</strong>: Involves pushing exercises, targeting muscles such as the chest, shoulders, and triceps.</li>
                    </span>
                    <li><strong>Pull</strong>: Focuses on pulling movements, targeting muscles such as the back, biceps, and rear delts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legs</strong>: Targets the lower body muscles, including the quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves.</li>
                    <div class="note">
                        <p>
                            <strong>Note</strong>: Breaking up workouts into push, pull, and legs maximizes work and rest to help you make gains.
                        </p>
                        <p>Additionally, PPL prioritize movement over individual muscle groups to effectively build functional strength.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dumbbells</strong>: You need a range of dumbbells or a pair of adjustable dumbbells. The heavier your dumbbells go, the longer you'll be able to make use of this routine.</li>
                    <div class="note">
                        <p><strong>Note</strong>: This routine is not a practical option if you only have a single pair of dumbbells.</p>
                    </div>
                    <li><strong>Bench</strong>: Some of the exercises require an adjustable bench. If you only have a flat (non-adjustable) bench, replace incline fly with flat fly on push day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pull-up bar</strong>: You can buy a simple door-mounted bar from online shops such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lazada.com.ph/">Lazada</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://shopee.ph">Shopee</a>.</li>

                <p>Muscle growth happens during recovery so make sure you have at least one rest day per week. If you don't <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5749041/" target="_blank">sleep enough</a> or eat right, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7785053/" target="_blank">it hinders your progress</a>.</p>
                <p>With that said, you have the option for a 4-day or 7-day cycle for this workout. The 4-day cycle is more beginner friendly as it allows your body to rest after working out for 3 consecutive days.</p>

                <h2 id="progression" class="progression">Progression</h2>
                <p>Perform three sets for each exercise, with 90 seconds rest in between each set. Do as many repetitions (reps) as possible, but no more than 12, for each set. For exercises that work each side individually (e.g. bent-over rows, lunges) a set counts after you have done both sides, and be sure to do the same number of reps per set on each side. If you are able to perform all three sets for 12 reps then move up to the next available weight on the next workout. If you do not make progress (increasing reps does count as progress) on an individual exercise after two attempts (i.e. you use the same weight and reps on that exercise for three consecutive workouts) then deload the weight for that specific exercise by two increments for the following workout and work your way back up.</p>
                <p>For pull-ups and hanging leg raises start with bodyweight only. To add weight hold a dumbbell between your feet. If you cannot do a pull-up, begin with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fitstream.com/exercises/negative-pull-up-a6041">negatives</a></p>
                <p>Start with the lightest dumbbells available for all other exercises. This will make sure you don't overdo it as you first start out and also allow you to practice form.</p>

                <h2 id="squats" class="squats">Squats</h2>
                <p>Since we all love leg days, squats deserve their own section. Because r/fitness loves squats I figure they deserve their own paragraph. Goblet squats are likely to be the limiting factor in this routine, in that you will probably reach your maximum dumbbell weight on this exercise first. When you do you may either move goblet squats to the end of leg day or replace them with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/DBSingleLegSplitSquat.html">Bulgarian split squats</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/DBSingleLegSplitSquat">pistol squats</a></p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Progressive Overload</strong>: Continuously aim to increase the weight lifted or the number of repetitions performed to stimulate muscle growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proper Form</strong>: Focus on maintaining proper form throughout each exercise to maximize effectiveness and reduce the risk of injury.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rest and Recovery</strong>: Ensure adequate rest between sets and incorporate rest days into your weekly routine to allow muscles to repair and grow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nutrition</strong>: Fuel your body with adequate nutrients, including protein, carbohydrates, and fats, to support muscle growth and recovery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hydration</strong>: Stay hydrated before, during, and after workouts to optimize performance and recovery.</li>
