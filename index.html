                    <p>This beginner-friendly program is designed for home workouts with adjustable dumbbells, perfect for those who prioritize dumbbell exercises and have limited gym access.</p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Note</strong>: While you can expect strength gains from this routine, it's designed more with hypertrophy in mind.

                    <p>A well-rounded physique demands targeted training. PPL divides workouts into push, pull, and leg exercises. By emphasizing compound movements and ample volume, this routine promotes muscle growth, and overall fitness.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <span>
                            <li><strong>Push</strong>: Involves pushing exercises, targeting muscles such as the chest, shoulders, and triceps.</li>
                        </span>
                        <li><strong>Pull</strong>: Focuses on pulling movements, targeting muscles such as the back, biceps, and rear delts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legs</strong>: Targets the lower body muscles, including the quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves.</li>
                        <div class="note">
                            <p>
                                <strong>Note</strong>: Breaking up workouts into push, pull, and legs maximizes work and rest to help you make gains.
                            </p>
                            <p>Additionally, PPL prioritize movement over individual muscle groups to effectively build functional strength.</p>

                        <li><strong>Dumbbells</strong>: You need a range of dumbbells or a pair of adjustable dumbbells. The heavier your dumbbells go, the longer you'll be able to make use of this routine.</li>
                        <div class="note">
                            <p><strong>Note</strong>: This routine is not a practical option if you only have a single pair of dumbbells.</p>
                        </div>
                        <li><strong>Bench</strong>: Some of the exercises require an adjustable bench. If you only have a flat (non-adjustable) bench, replace incline fly with flat fly on push day.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pull-up bar</strong>: You can buy a simple door-mounted bar from online shops such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lazada.com.ph/">Lazada</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://shopee.ph">Shopee</a>.</li>

                    <p>Muscle growth happens during recovery so make sure you have at least one rest day per week. If you don't <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5749041/" target="_blank">sleep enough</a> or eat right, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7785053/" target="_blank">it hinders your progress</a>.</p>
                    <p>With that said, you have the option for a 4-day or 7-day cycle for this workout. The 4-day cycle is more beginner friendly as it allows your body to rest after working out for 3 consecutive days.</p>
                    <div class="important">
                        <p><strong>Important</strong>: This regimen can be physically demanding. Depending on your fitness level, you should feel muscle soreness in the first weeks of training, which is reduced as your body adapts to the workout. Always listen to your body and <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/10-tips-for-exercising-safely" target="_blank">prioritize safety</a>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Important</strong>: Things to keep in mind:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start with bodyweight only (no weights) for pull-ups, hanging leg raises, lying leg raises, and sit-ups. If you can't do a pull-up, do <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbPURTSxQLY">negatives</a> instead.</li>
                        <li>Begin with the lightest weight available for all other exercises. This ensures you don't overdo it as you first start out and also allow you to practice form.</li>
                        <li>Count a set after you’ve done both sides for exercises that work each side individually (e.g. bent-over rows, lunges). Do the same number of reps per set on each side.</li>
                        <li>Move up to the next available weight on the next workout once you’ve hit the maximum rep range on all 3 sets for an exercise.</li>
                        <li>Switch to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPlKPjohFS0">bulgarian split squats</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5-vdgJc0I">pistol squats</a> when you've maxed out the dumbbell weight for goblet squats.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Progressive Overload</strong>: Continuously aim to increase the weight lifted or the number of repetitions performed to stimulate muscle growth.</li>
                        <li><strong>Proper Form</strong>: Focus on maintaining proper form throughout each exercise to maximize effectiveness and reduce the risk of injury.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rest and Recovery</strong>: Ensure adequate rest between sets and incorporate rest days into your weekly routine to allow muscles to repair and grow.</li>
                        <li><strong>Nutrition</strong>: Fuel your body with adequate nutrients, including protein, carbohydrates, and fats, to support muscle growth and recovery.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hydration</strong>: Stay hydrated before, during, and after workouts to optimize performance and recovery.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 id="deload">Deload</h2>
                    <p>If you don't notice progress on an individual exercise (e.g. you use the same weight and reps on that exercise for three consecutive workouts), then reduce the weight for that specific exercise by two increments for the next workout and work your way back up.</p>
