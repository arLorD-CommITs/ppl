            <h2 class="overview">Overview</h2>
            <p>This is a workout program that's recommended for beginners or for people who are just starting their fitness journey. You can do this at home with a pair of adjustable dumbbells and is suitable if you're in an area with limited access to gym equipment.</p>
            <p>This program is a decent option for people who don't have time to go the gym and prefers to workout at home. At its core, this workout is essentially a dumbbell-centric routine. Therefore, the exercises are designed to work the advantages of dumbbells. Though there are some exercises (e.g. Squats), where you can opt to use a barbell instead.</p>
            <div class="note">
                <strong>Note</strong>: While you can expect strength gains from this routine, it's designed more with hypertrophy in mind.

            <h3 class="what-is-ppl">What is PPL?</h3>
            <p>PPL is a combination of exercises that promote muscle growth. It's composed of 3 collections of exercises:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Push</strong>: In the "push" phase, the goal is to train all the upper body pushing muscles (i.e. the chest, shoulders, and triceps).</li>
                <li><strong>Pull</strong>: For "pull", you train all the upper body pulling muscles (e.g. the back and biceps).</li>
                <li><strong>Legs</strong>: Lastly, for the "legs" workout, you train the entire lower body.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="requirements">Required equipment</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dumbbells</strong>: You need a range of dumbbells or a pair of adjustable dumbbells. The heavier your dumbbells go, the longer you will be able to make use of this routine.</li>
                <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This routine is not a practical option if you only have a single pair of dumbbells.</div>
                <li><strong>Bench</strong>: Ideally you will have access to an adjustable bench. If you only have a flat bench, replace incline fly with flat fly on push day.</li>
                <li><strong>Pull-up bar</strong>: Every gym should have at least some place to do pull-ups. If you are working out at home buy a simple door-mounted bar.</li>
            </ul>
